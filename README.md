# Fuji 3D SBS Video Converter

This is a simple offline tool for Windows, Mac, or Linux that converts rare **Fuji 3D AVI video files** into standard **Side-By-Side (SBS) MP4 videos** with audio. It supports both single video conversion and batch processing of entire folders.

The converter extracts both left and right eye streams, merges them into SBS images, preserves the original audio, and outputs a clean MP4 file that works in modern 3D players, VR headsets, or YouTube.
